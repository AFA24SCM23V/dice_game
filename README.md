Dice Dazzle: Rules of Fun!

Welcome to the Dice Dazzle, where you'll have a "rolling" good time! 
Here are the quirky rules:

🎲 Roll or Risk?: Each player gets a chance to roll the dice as many times as they dare. Oho, But beware! If the dice shows a 1, all your current points go bye-bye!☹️

🏆 Hold or Hesitate?: Decide wisely! You can choose to "Hold" at any time to add your current points to your total score and secure them. But if you get too greedy and roll a 1, it's all gone! 😜

🎉 Victory Dance: The first player to reach 100 points wins the game💥
